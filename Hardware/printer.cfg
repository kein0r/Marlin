# This file serves as documentation for config parameters of delta
# style printers. One may copy and edit this file to configure a new
# delta printer. Only parameters unique to delta printers are
# described here - see the "example.cfg" file for description of
# common config parameters.

# DO NOT COPY THIS FILE WITHOUT CAREFULLY READING AND UPDATING IT
# FIRST. Incorrectly configured parameters may cause damage.

# The stepper_a section describes the stepper controlling the front
# left tower (at 210 degrees). This section also controls the homing
# parameters (homing_speed, homing_retract_dist) for all towers.

#define MANUAL_Z_HOME_POS 299.9 // Distance between the nozzle to printbed after homing
#   Distance (in mm) between the nozzle and the bed when the nozzle is

#   Length (in mm) of the diagonal rod that connects this tower to the

#   stepper_b and stepper_c this parameter defaults to the value
#   specified for stepper_a.
#angle:
#   This option specifies the angle (in degrees) that the tower is
#   at. The default is 210 for stepper_a, 330 for stepper_b, and 90
#   for stepper_c.

# The stepper_b section describes the stepper controlling the front

kinematics: delta
#   This option must be "delta" for linear delta printers.
max_velocity: 300
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) of the toolhead relative to the
#   print. This parameter must be specified.
max_accel: 3000
#   Maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the toolhead relative to the
#   print. This parameter must be specified.
max_z_velocity: 150
#   For delta printers this limits the maximum velocity (in mm/s) of
#   moves with z axis movement. This setting can be used to reduce the
#   maximum speed of up/down moves (which require a higher step rate
#   than other moves on a delta printer). The default is to use
#   max_velocity for max_z_velocity.
minimum_z_position: -2
#   The minimum Z position that the user may command the head to move
#   to.  The default is 0.
#delta_radius: 134.009032

#define DELTA_CARRIAGE_OFFSET 13.0 + 11.8/2 + (DELTA_CORNER_OFFSET) // mm
#   Radius (in mm) of the horizontal circle formed by the three linear
#   axis towers. This parameter may also be calculated as:
#    delta_radius = smooth_rod_offset - effector_offset - carriage_offset
#   This parameter must be provided.

# The delta_calibrate section enables a DELTA_CALIBRATE extended
# g-code command that can calibrate the tower endstop positions and
# angles.
[delta_calibrate]
radius: 50
#   Radius (in mm) of the area that may be probed. This is typically
#   the size of the printer bed. This parameter must be provided.
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the
#   calibration. The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#samples: 1
#   The number of times to probe each point.  The probed z-values
#   will be averaged.  The default is to probe 1 time.
#sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to retract between each sample if
#   sampling more than once.  Default is 2mm.

# Mesh Bed Leveling. One may define a [bed_mesh] config section
# to enable move transformations that offset the z axis based
# on a mesh generated from probed points. Note that bed_mesh
# and bed_tilt are incompatible, both cannot be defined.  When
# using a probe to home the z-axis, it is recommended to define
# a [homing_override] section in printer.cfg to home toward the
# center of the print area.
[bed_mesh]
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the
#   calibration. The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#samples: 1
#   The number of times to probe each point.  The probed z-values
#   will be averaged.  The default is to probe 1 time.
min_point: 10,10
#   An X,Y point defining the minimum coordinate to probe on
#   the bed. Note that this refers to the nozzle position,
#   and take care that you do not define a point that will move
#   the probe off of the bed. This parameter must be provided.
max_point: 70,70
#   An X,Y point defining the maximum coordinate to probe on
#   the bed. Follow the same precautions as listed in min_point.
#   Also note that this does not necessarily define the last point
#   probed, only the maximum coordinate. This parameter must be provided.
